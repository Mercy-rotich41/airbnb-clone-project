ðŸ§¾ Project Overview This project is a full-stack clone of the Airbnb platform designed to simulate a real-world web application. The objective is to build a responsive, user-friendly booking system where users can browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings. The project serves as an opportunity to practice full-stack development, team collaboration, and software engineering best practices.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals Build a fully functional accommodation booking platform.

Implement modern UI/UX design with a mobile-first approach.

Design reusable frontend components and maintain clean architecture.

Develop secure, scalable backend APIs and database logic.

Collaborate in a structured team environment with clearly defined roles.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

Design: Figma (for UI/UX mockups)

Version Control: Git & GitHub

Why Design Properties Matter
Identifying the design properties (like colors, fonts, and spacing) of a mockup ensures consistency and clarity across all UI components. This leads to:

A unified look and feel throughout the application.

Easier collaboration between designers and developers.

Better user experience through consistent visual hierarchy and accessibility.

Faster development time as reusable styles are defined early.
